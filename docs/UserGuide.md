title: CareFlow User Guide
---

Careflow is a **desktop application for patient and drug inventory management, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you are a receptionist for a GP clinic and you can type fast, Careflow can get your patient and drugs management tasks done faster than traditional applications.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 installed in your Computer.
   * [Installing Java 11 on Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-371F38CC-248F-49EC-BB9C-C37FC89E52A0)
   * [Installing Java 11 on macOS](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-macos.html)

2. Download the latest `careflow.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-3/tp).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your careflowBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar careflow.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:
   * `p list` : Lists all patients.

   * `d list` : Lists all drugs.

   * `add -n John Doe -ph 98765432 -em johnd@example.com -ad John Street, Block 123, #01-01 -dob 21-01-2000 -g male -ic T3871918C` : Adds a patient named `John Doe` to the patient records.

   * `p delete -in 3` : Deletes the 3rd patient record shown in the current list.

   * `p clear` : Deletes all patient records.

   * `d clear` : Deletes all drug records

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

#### Notes about command format:
* Words in UPPER CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in add -n NAME, NAME is a parameter which can be used as add -n John Doe.
