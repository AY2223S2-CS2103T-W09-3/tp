Careflow is a **desktop application for patient and drug inventory management, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

If you are a receptionist for a GP clinic and you can type fast, Careflow can get your patient and drugs management tasks done faster than traditional applications.
